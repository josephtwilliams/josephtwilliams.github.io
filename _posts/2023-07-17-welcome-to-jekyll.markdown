Welcome to my blog. I’m Joe, a technology enthusiast from Melbourne, Australia. At the moment, I’m travelling in Europe (Barcelona) after completing my undergraduate studies. Given that this is my first post, I will provide a brief summary of my background and my intentions for this blog.

I studied a Bachelor of Commerce alongside a Diploma in Computing at the University of Melbourne. Double degrees are not offered at UniMelb, and this pathway was the closest I could get to a Commerce/Computer Science degree. My favourite subjects were Machine Learning, Algorithmic Trading, Information Security/Privacy, and Visualisation/Data Wrangling.

It’s not surprising that my first project was [AussieQuant][Aussiequant], an alternative data provider for retail investors in ASX-listed companies. The website has consistent users from around the world and remains a place where I can test ideas on web development, data engineering, and complement my role as a part-time data analyst.

Currently, I’m self-teaching linear algebra and calculus to improve my intuition behind machine learning concepts. This has proven challenging, especially while travelling, but rewarding given my interests in AI and decentralisation. I hope to use this blog to explore these ideas, improve my writing, and maintain a record of my thoughts over time.
