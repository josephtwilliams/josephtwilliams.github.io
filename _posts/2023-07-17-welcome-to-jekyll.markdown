Welcome to my blog. I'm Joe, a technology enthusist from Melbourne, Australia. At the moment I'm travelling Europe (Barcelona) after completing my undergraduate studies. Given this is my first post I shall provide a brief summary on my background, and my intention with this blog. 

I studied a Bachelor of Commerce alongside a Diploma in Computing at the University of Melbourne. Double degrees are not offered at UniMelb and this pathway was the closest I could get to a Commerce/Computer Science degree. My favourite subjects were Machine learning, Algorithmic Trading, Information Security/Privacy, and Visualisation/Data Wrangling. 

It's not surprising my first project was [AussieQuant][Aussiequant], an alternative data provider for retail investors on ASX listed companies. The website has consistent users from around the world, and remains somewhere I can test ideas on web development, data engineering, and complement my role as a part-time data anlayst. 

Currently I'm self-teaching linear algebra and calculus to improve my intuitiuons behind machine learning conepts. This has proven challenging, especially while travelling, but rewarding given my interests in AI and decentralisation. I hope to use this blog to explore these ideas, improve my writing and maintain a record of my thoughts over time.
